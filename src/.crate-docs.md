An efficient JSON [`Value`][value] crate for Rust.

**This crate is thoroughly tested, but it's still very early in development.
Feedback is greatly appreciated.**

## Why another JSON library?

This library is for developers who:

- Are working with JSON, but either don't want to or can't use `serde`.
- Want to parse a JSON Value from a slice with minimal allocations.

If neither of those situations apply to you, you should seriously consider using
`serde` and [`serde-json`][serde-json] or [`simd-json`][simd-json].

What real-world case does this use case fit? Parsing [JSON-LD Compacted Document
Form][json-ld] requires inspecting the JSON to find the `@context` field, and
using the information within the `@context` field to interpret the rest of the
document. This form of JSON-LD representation is used by
[ActivityPub][activitypub], which is a protocol that power [the
Fediverse][fediverse].

## What makes JustJson interesting?

The optimal use case for JustJson is when parsing an `&str` or `&[u8]`. When
parsing either of these, the returned [`Value`][value] type is `Value<&str>`. All strings
and numbers are kept in their original form in the [`JsonString`][string] and
[`JsonNumber`][number] types. While they are kept in their original form, they
are fully validated when parsed. **The net effect is significantly fewer
allocations when parsing a JSON value.**

[`JsonString`][string] implements `PartialCmp<&str>` such that if the
`JsonString` contains escape sequences, the comparison is handled correctly.
Each `JsonString` tracks its decoded length as well as whether any escapes are
present, allowing this comparison to be very efficient.

```rust
let json = justjson::JsonString::from_json("\"Hello, World!\"").unwrap();
assert_eq!(json, "Hello, World!");
```

JustJson also offers an even faster method for parsing: [`Document`][document].
When parsing an array or an object into a `Value`, the parser doesn't know how
large each array or object will be until it parses the rest of the object.
`Document` builds a tree representing the JSON value in a single `Vec`, further
reducing the number of allocations needed when parsing a document.

This extra speed comes at the expense of an API that requires iteration to
inspect the `Document`.

## Benchmarks

You can run the benchmarks by executing `RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native" cargo
bench -p benchmarks --all-features`. There currently is only a single benchmark,
testing a small JSON payload in both pretty and compact representations.

## Usage of Unsafe Code

This crate uses unsafe code only when converting from raw incoming data to UTF-8
data. The parser fully verifies that the data is valid UTF-8 before these
functions are used.
